/*

Write a function/proc/lambda called _ that always returns 5.

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can only use the following characters:

~!@#$%^&*()-_+=[]\{}|:;"'<,>.?/`

*/

// remove spaces in between to make this work
_ = () => ("" == "") + ("" == "") + ("" == "") + ("" == "") + ("" == "");
